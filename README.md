Movies Data Analysis Project
This project is a data analysis of a movies dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. 
The aim is to extract insights about movie popularity, voting trends, genre distributions, and production trends over the years.
The dataset (`mymoviedb.csv`) contains information about ~9,800 movies, including:

- Release date
- Title
- Overview
- Popularity score
- Vote count
- Average vote rating
- Original language
- Genre(s)
- Poster URL
  
Data Cleaning
Steps performed:
- Removed unnecessary columns: `Overview`, `Original_Language`, `Poster_Url`
- Converted `Release_Date` to year
- Checked for and removed duplicate and null values
- Categorized `Vote_Average` into 4 levels:
